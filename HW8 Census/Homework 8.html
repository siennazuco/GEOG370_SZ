<h1>Homework 8: Census data ratios and categories</h1>
<h2>Sienna Zuco</h2>
<h3>These maps display the ratio of Black people (25 years+) with a Bachelor's degree or higher compared to the total population of people (25 years+) with a Bachelor's degree or higher. I chose to create this ratio so I could understand in terms of the bigger picture how many Black people have Bachelor's degrees since minorities tend to have less education compared to their white counterparts. This percentage is displayed in 3 different classifications, including equal interval, natural breaks, and pretty breaks. Equal intervals can be good because each interval is the same size so the data is distributed more evenly. But, equal intervals are meant for more continuous data and this data is not as continuous as other data sets. In terms of natural breaks, this can be a good way to classify data by demonstrating the naturally occuring shifts in the data set. This may alter the data less but since the natural breaks of this data set may not align with the natural breaks of another data set, it is not as good for comparing and contrasting. Lastly, pretty breaks make the legend and data displayed in the map easier to read and understand but it may not properly portray the data. Generally, this data set continuously portrays concentrations of Black people with Bachelor's degrees or higher among the cities. Overall, I think the pretty breaks best portrays this data since the percentage is range is so low, it uses the largest range for the breaks better portrays how low the percentage is across the state. </h3>

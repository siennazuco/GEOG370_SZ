<h1>Homework 8: Census data ratios and categories</h1>
<h2>Sienna Zuco</h2>
<p>These maps display the ratio of Black people (25 years+) with a Bachelor's degree or higher compared to the total population of people (25 years+) with a Bachelor's degree or higher. I chose to create this ratio so I could understand the percentage of Black people have Bachelor's degrees since minorities tend to have less education compared to their white counterparts. Across the dataset and these aps, that percentage is incredibly low. This percentage is displayed in 3 different classifications, including equal interval, natural breaks, and pretty breaks.</p>

<h2>Map 1</h2>

    </a>
    <p> This map classifies the ratio of Black people to the total population in terms of equal intervals. This classification can be good because each interval is the same size so the data is evenly distributed. But, since this data set does not have a alrge range nor is it very continous, equal intervals does not display this as well.</p>

<h2>Map 2</h2>

    </a>
    <p>In this map, the data is classified In terms of natural breaks. This can be a good way to classify data by demonstrating the naturally occuring changes or turning points within the data set. Furthermore, the data is portrayed as more of a range compared to the the first map with more states reaching the middle ground. This may alter the data less but since the natural breaks of this data set may not align with the natural breaks of another data set, it is not as good for comparing and contrasting.</p>

<h2>Map 3</h2>
<a href="./Pretty Breaks Oregon.png">
    <img src="./Pretty Breaks Oregon.png" alt="My Map" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <p> Lastly, this map is classified using pretty breaks. Pretty breaks make the legend and data displayed in the map easier to read and understand but it may not properly portray the data. But, in this case, the data seems less concetrated in cities, especially compared to the first map, which may be beneficial because it is almost always a given that those with higher education are in cities.</p>

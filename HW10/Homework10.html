<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
<h2>Sienna Zuco</h2>
<h3>Currently, I am in an Urban Planning class on transportation systems. One of the first things we learned was the importance of accessibility, walkability, and bikeability around bus stops and major transit centers. Oftentimes, people will only want to take public transit if a stop is within 5-10 minutes walking distance. This roughly equates to 1/4 mile. So, for this project I wanted to look into the bikeability of the downtown Seattle area and whether or not there were easily accessible bike paths to and from streetcar stations within a 1/4-mile radius. As someone who is currently graduating and looking to live in Seattle, I wanted to see what sort of accessibility there existed because I will not have a car. For this map, I created a 1/4-mile buffer around streetcar stations in downtown Seattle. I then dissolved the buffer boundaries as there was a lot of overlap. Next, I intersected the bike path and lane data with the radius data I had created in order to determine if there were bike paths within a 1/4-mile radius of the stop, and if so, where would they be. This map shows us that as streetcar stops are fairly congregated within several corridors, bike path and lane access to and from these stops also congregates in those areas. While there are a lot of bike paths and lanes around the city with access to stations, different stations have more bike access than others. This is seen at the stations in Belltown and in another in the International District. For a follow-up project, I think it would be really interesting to see where bus stations are located and how they intersect with bike lanes and paths in order to get a better idea of what access to the whole transit system looks like.</h3>

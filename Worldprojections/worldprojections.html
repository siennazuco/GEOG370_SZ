    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections using QGIS.</h1>
    
    <p>Using QGIS and after uploading the data given using "add vector", you can apply an indicatrix mapper. This will add various circles and grids to portray the differences in size, distance, and shape of projections. When looking to change the current projection of the map, you must go to properties under project and then you can pick from various coordinate reference systems. You can search projections by name, use the given authority ID, or just browse!</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
   
    <p>This projection looks the most "normal". It is different from the well-known Mercator projection as Greenland seems much smaller than the continent of Africa. This projection seems to balance size, distance, and shape the best.</p>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    
    <p>The projection makes you think you are looking at a slightly stretched world so you can visually see all the countries. This projection adjusts the sizes and shapes of countries, especially as you get further away from the Prime Meridian. Overall, I do like the aesthetics of the projection. </p>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator Projection 3857</h2>
    
    <p>This projection, while the most well-known, I believe is unfairly inaccurate. This projection displays European countries, esoecially Greenland, as much larger than the "Global South" countries within continents like Africa. Although used at one point for navigation, I feel like there are better projections out there than this one.</p>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel Projection 53018</h2>
    
    <p>This projection shows all countries slightly less stretched than the Aitoff projection. It accounts for size a little better than the Mercator projection. But, as you get the poles, size does increase.</p>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection 54034</h2>
    
    <p>This seems like a very squished projection. Like they used the light bulb projection analogy when describing cylindrical projections, this projection really loses shape as you go towards the poles and lacks to give ful views of all countries the further you get from the equator.</p>

    <h2>World Equal Distant Conic Projection 54027</h2>
    
    <p>This projection really portrays proximity of countries, especially at the north pole. But, the further you get from the north pole, the more scewed the countries get. It makes Antarctica look enormous. This projection could be misleading in that manner.</p>

    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection 102016</h2>
   
    <p>Slightly different from the previous projection, this squishes the north pole even more, further axcerbating the enlarging effects of the projection on Antarctica. Although aesethetically pleasing, does not seem to be the most helpful and knowing where things are, understanding true shapes of countries, their sizes, etc...</p>

    <h2>Sphere Bonne Projection 53024</h2>
   
    <p>I chose to include this projection for its interesting stretching. It appears to do the opposite as the Mercator in terms of enlarging countries of the southern hemisphere. But this enlarging distorts their true size and shape and lacks to even include a full picture of Australia. But, Antarctica appears closer to its true size.</p>

    </a>
    <h2>Sphere Eckert Projection 53015</h2>
   
    <p>this final projection I chose due to its interesting "bend" in the middle of the map. That bend appears to attemp to equalize the sizes of all the continents as the circles remain fairly similar in size. Although, size does continue to enlargen as you get towards the poles, this projection appears to be counteracting that effect with the bend in the center, attempting to neurtralize size and shape. <p3>

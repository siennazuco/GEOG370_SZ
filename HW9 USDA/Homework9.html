<h1>Homework 9: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map</h1>
<h2>Sienna Zuco</h2>
<h3>This map portrays the production of milk in pounds per head, as in per cow, using the natural breaks (jenks) categorization. The lighter the color, the lower the production of milk per cow in that county. This is different from total production as this production is averaged to the number of cows in that county, normalizing the data.  This map portrays that counties such as Kewaunee and Dane have higher milk production per the number of cows within that county. I chose to look at milk production in Wisconsin because it is one of the largest milk and cheese producers in the country.</h3>

<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>SIENNA ZUCO</h2>
<h3>This map displays the variation in education level attainment across North Carolina. This data set looked specifically at the the total population of people both over the age of 25 and the age of 65 who had a Bachelor's degree or higher. Where counties are more pink, education levels are lower, whereas more green counties have higher education level attainment. As you can see, more people have a Bachelor's degree or higher in places where there are universities or cities. This can be seen in Orange County, where UNC-Chapel Hill is and in Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is. Overall, this data was not entirely surprising but somewhat disappointing that education levels above high school remain fairly low across the state.</h3>
